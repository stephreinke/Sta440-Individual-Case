# 1. Background
Surgery patients often face complex recovery processes, and
understanding their metabolic needs is critical for optimizing care
through targeted feeding. Indirect calorimetry (IC) is a standard method
for measuring energy expenditure via respiration (Rattanachaiwong and
Singer, 2019). Resting energy expenditure (REE), measured via IC, plays
a key role in guiding nutritional support, which can improve patient
outcomes post–operation. However, there are significant gaps in the
literature regarding REE in recovering cardiac surgery patients. The
goal of the present study was to measure REE and REE/kg in these
patients during their stays in the intensive care unit (ICU) and
subsequently in the step–down unit (SDU), so that this information can
be used to improve post–surgery care. A total of 11 patients (4 obese, 7
non–obese) were included in the study, with 35 indirect REE measurements
taken throughout their recoveries to capture different stages of
metabolic demand. These measurements were collected repeatedly, allowing
for comparison between patients on ventilators versus those who were
not, as well as between ICU and step–down unit patients.
